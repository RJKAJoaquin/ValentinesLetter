                <span id="heading">What is Reducing?</span><br><br>

                Reducing is the act of, well, reducing your usage of everything. This can include how much food you buy or how much toothpaste you use. Everything we use (or buy but don't use) ends up as waste polluting the land or sea but there are many small ways to reducing your waste like:
                
                <ul>
                    <li>Bringing your own bag instead of using a one-use plastic bag</li>
                    <li>Replacing most paper with digital documents</li>
                    <li>Buying only what you need at the moment or very near future and many more</li>
                </ul>
                
                Energy and fuel are also things you should minimize on. This doesn't mean you should stop using either altogether, but being mindful of the how much you use can already go a long way with decreasing your waste.

        <!-- reuse -->
        <div class="hidden" id="reuse">

            <span id="heading">Reuse</span>

            <img src="../images/reuse.png" alt="reuse"><br><br>

            <div>
                <hr>

                <span id="heading">What is Reusing?</span><br><br>

                Reusing is quite self-explanatory. Keep reusing all of the things you have that you know can still be used. In this day and age, it can be easy to forget that we don't need the brand new thing when what we have still works be it phones, clothes, or other "trendy" items. Although you should note that reusing applies to many more items and categories than just those I identified. Maybe you want to reuse your perfectly usable plastic bag instead of grabbing another at the supermarket.<br><br>

                Repairing, although sometimes grouped separetely as the 4 or 5 R's, is also a part of this category and is arguably more important to spread than reusing. The main message of repairing is that, instead of throwing your broken item away, maybe you, or someone else, can repair your item, saving it from being turned into waste. This can apply to many, many things like electronics and clothing.

                <span id="heading">What is Recycling</span><br><br>

                <!-- div text -->
                Recycling is a bit more abstract than the others. A good way to describe it is "repurposing". Essentially, 
                recycling is what would happen if an item can't be repaired or reused. Although this is the category that 
                needs the most thought and time, there are still many ways you could recycle without putting much thought 
                into it.
                <!-- /div text -->

                <ul>
                    <li>Sending your wastes to scrap yards or salvage yards</li>
                    <li>Paper can be recycled in many, many ways so it's good to keep your excess papers and many more</li>
                </ul>

                <!-- div text -->
                If all else fails and you find recycling being too much effort still, you can just leave the recycling to 
                someone else and throw as much as you can in the nearest recycling bin. Although before you do, make 
                sure what you're throwing is actually recyclable before throwing it.
